## ONNX Model Conversion Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts to convert various machine learning and deep learning models into the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format.
ONNX is an open format built to represent machine learning models, enabling them to be transferred between different frameworks.

✨ Features
📦 Scripts to convert models from popular frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.) to ONNX.

🛠 Examples for handling different model architectures.

🔍 Utilities for verifying and inspecting ONNX models.

🚀 Ready to adapt for your own models.
